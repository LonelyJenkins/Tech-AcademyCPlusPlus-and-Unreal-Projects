# Tech AcademyCPlusPlus and Unreal Projects
 All projects utlizing C++ and Unreal Engine will be located in this repository.
 These projects have been created to display competency in the C++ language and usage of the Unreal Engine.

These projects have been created to display competency in both the C++ language and the Unreal Engine. 
Within you will find multiple simple programs created with C++, as well as a basic game demo made in the Unreal Engine.

In order to run the non-Unreal files, they will have to be opened in an IDE and run in the Debug Console. Interaction instructions, if any, will be given in the console.
The Unreal Demo will soon be listed on itch.io; however, projects can be downloaded and run in the Unreal Engine 5 editor.
All code within is my original work. All models (with the exception of all the boxy environments created within Unreal), textures, audio and animations are premade assets.
